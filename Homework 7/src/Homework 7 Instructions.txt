1. EMPLOYEE ORGANIZATION
You have been hired by the Sandwich Queen Company to help organize their employees.
Create an Employee superclass which contains:
	- A field for name
	- A field for payrate
	- A constructor that assigns the fields
Create a class called SandwichArtisan which extends Employee and contains:
	- A field for the number of sandwiches made per hour
	- A field for customers served per hour
	- Appropriate constructor and accessors
Create a class called QueenManager which extends Employee and contains:
	- A field for the number of employees managed
	- A field for the paybonus the manager receives
	- A void method that calculates the paybonus as:
		paybonus = total customers served per hour * 2
	  	The method must take an array of SandwichArtisans as an argument to calculate the total customers served by all the artisans.
		Store the result in your class field.
	- Appropriate constructor and accessors

Write a main class which creates 1 QueenManager and 3 SandwichArtisans, making up values for their fields (no need to ask the user).
Add the 3 SandwichArtisans to an array and use it to calculate the paybonus of the Manager.
Output the name and paybonus earned by the manager, and search your array for the employee with the most customers served.
Output the name of the employee as the employee of the month.
